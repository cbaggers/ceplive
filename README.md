ceplive-mode
============

An emacs minor mode providing yasnippets and helper functions for working with cepl

For a while this will contain fairly bad practices as this is my first time dealing with elisp.

add this to .emacs

    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/Code/lisp/ceplive-mode")
    (require 'ceplive-mode)
